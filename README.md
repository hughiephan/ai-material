# AI Materials

A comprehensive repository of AI educational materials for my teaching at FPT University, including lessons, tutorials, and assignments. Providing detailed explanations of core AI principles, design context, and fairness considerations. Hands-on coding tutorials guide students in implementing AI algorithms using tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch, with practical applications illustrated through industry case studies. Assignments range from weekly tasks to semester-long projects, reinforcing concepts and encouraging innovation. Accessible online, the materials support various learning styles and are regularly updated to reflect the latest advancements in AI. This project aims to equip students with a solid understanding of AI, practical skills, and the ability to critically evaluate in the field.
